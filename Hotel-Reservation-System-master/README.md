# Hotel-Reservation-System

#This project was created for my Database Management Class (198:336) at Rutgers. It runs on Flask with MySQL Integration on the AWS Platform.

#As a whole the website includes functionalities such as making an account, reserving a room, adding reviews, viewing customer analytics, and viewing various reservations/reviews. It also has functionality for the admin user who can go in to add more hotel locations, view all reservations by all users and display various analytics (top rated rooms, services, and customers).
